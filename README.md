Overview
Explore over 139 years of baby naming trends in the United States using a dataset 

Dataset
Source: us_baby_names.csv
Time Span: 1880 to 2018

 Key Insights
Classic names ruled early decades; recent years show more diversity.
Gender-neutral names are on the rise.
A small number of names have remained in the top ranks for generations.

 Housing Data Exploration
Overview
An initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a housing dataset to understand property prices, locations, and key features.

Dataset
Source: housing.csv

 Key Insights
Housing prices and bedrooms have some missing data ‚Äî handled with imputation or analysis-aware filtering.
Most homes are located near the ocean or in inland areas.
Median income and housing age show regional patterns.

Purpose
Great for learning EDA basics: inspecting data, handling missing values, and preparing for machine learning.



Movie Data Analysis (TMDB Dataset)
Overview
A deep dive into 44,691 movies from the TMDb (The Movie Database) API, analyzing financial performance, popularity, and audience ratings.

Dataset
Source: tmdb_5000_movies.csv (or similar)

Key Insights
High budget doesn‚Äôt always mean high revenue ‚Äî some low-budget films are breakout hits.
Movies released in summer or December tend to earn more.
Audience ratings (vote average) are tightly clustered around 6‚Äì7/10.
 Purpose
Ideal for understanding entertainment industry trends and building predictive models (e.g., box office success).

 Tools Used
pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, Jupyter Notebook

 Movie Recommendation System

Uses MovieLens 100K
 dataset.

Spark Projects: Degrees of Separation & Movie Recommendations
Two powerful Apache Spark applications demonstrating graph processing and collaborative filtering for recommendations.

Built using PySpark, these projects analyze large-scale datasets to solve real-world problems:

Find the shortest path between fictional characters (BFS in Spark)
Recommend similar movies using cosine similarity
 Project 1: Degrees of Separation (Marvel Superheroes)
 Problem
How many degrees of separation are there between two Marvel characters based on comic book co-appearances?

This project implements a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm on a graph of superheroes to find the shortest path from a starting character to a target.

 Dataset
marvel-graph.txt: A tab-separated file where:
First column = Hero ID
Subsequent columns = IDs of heroes they appeared with
Inspired by Marvel Comics data from the Stanford Network Analysis Project (SNAP) 

 How It Works
Start: Character ID 5306 (e.g., Loki)
Target: Character ID 14 (e.g., Spider-Man)
Uses BFS iterations to propagate through the graph
Employs a Spark accumulator to detect when the target is found
Nodes are colored:
GRAY: Being explored
BLACK: Already processed
WHITE: Not yet discovered
üõ†Ô∏è Key Spark Concepts Used
flatMap() for spreading the search
reduceByKey() to merge duplicate nodes
Accumulators for global counters
In-memory distributed graph traversal

 Project 2: Movie Recommendation System
 Problem
Given a movie, recommend other movies that are most similar in terms of user ratings.

Uses cosine similarity to compute how closely two movies are rated across users.

 Dataset
ml-100k/u.data: User ratings (user ID, movie ID, rating, timestamp)
ml-100k/u.item: Movie metadata (ID, title, genre, etc.)
From the classic MovieLens 100K dataset
 How It Works
Join ratings on same users but different movies
Compute cosine similarity:

Filter results for the input movie
Rank and return top 10 most similar movies
